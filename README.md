# LightningSDK
The Lightning SDK is our attempt at making an improved version of the FTC SDK. It will hopefully make it easier for teams to program their robots.

For technical questions regarding the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:

In this latest version of the FTC SDK (20150803_001) the following changes should be noted:

 * New user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * An init() method is added to the OpMode class.
   - For this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method.
   - Eventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an "INIT" button on driver station.
   - The init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the user's op mode).
   - The start() and stop() methods are optional.
 * A new LinearOpMode class is introduced.
   - Teams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model.
   - Teams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode.
 * The API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated.
   - Support for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working.
 * The hardware loop has been updated for better performance.

##### Android device min reqmts:

* Android Kit Kat (for improved WiFi Direct support).
* USB OTG support (for gamepad support and to connect to Modern Robotics modules)
* Root access for driver station is required if you want to force WiFi channel selection.
